Due 12 September 2012

Finds an optimal solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem with 3 missionaries and cannibals on one side of the river.
Approach: Graph-based Uninformed Bidirectional search.  Alternates expanding state nodes from both the initial state and the goal state
	until the two searches meet at a common state in the middle.  The solution sequence of actions is constructed from the two search sequences.
	Remembers which states have been explored in the past to prevent loops by storing them in an associative array.
Search Strategy: Breadth First Search - guranteed to find an optimal solution.
